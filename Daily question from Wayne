# This program works, it counts from zero to nine.
# The "\t" in the print statement will print TAB character.

# Exercise: modify this program to make it print the uppercase
# alphabet A-Z instead of numbers. Keep the while() loop structure
# and only print one letter at a time in the loop.
# Hint: read about the chr() and ord() builtin functions in the
# Reference Library, in the Documentation at www.python.org
# Also, it may help to look at an ascii table: www.asciitable.com

counter = 65
# print(ord("A"))
# print(ord("Z"))
while counter < 91:
	print("\t", chr(counter))
	counter = counter + 1
